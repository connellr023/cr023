#### Overview
This project specifically is different as I used it as an introduction to the Rust programming language with its web assembly compilation feature. This was created utilizing the <a target="_blank" href="https://yew.rs/">Yew</a> framework which is very similar to *React* for creating front end web services.

#### Notes
I am aware this could have been easily created with traditional *React* or even *JQuery* to be honest. However, as mentioned above, this project is mainly for learning Rust and it was by no means practical in comparison. :cry:
